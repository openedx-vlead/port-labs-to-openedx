* Base1 Machine Details
+ Operating System : CentOS 6.7 (64 bit) virtualized with OpenVZ and KVM.
+ For more info about H/W and OS details please [[http://wiki.vlabs.ac.in/index.php/Base1][Click here]]
* Process for creating new VM on base1
+ ssh into base1 machine using below command.
#+begin_example
ssh -X root@<base1_ip>
#+end_example
*Note :-* Here -X will allow us to open application in GUI mode.
+ Change directory into vms folder
#+begin_example 
cd /mnt/das1/vms
#+end_example
+ Create a folder with VM name
#+begin_example
mkdir test_vm
#+end_example
+ Change PWD to newly created VM folder and use 'qemu-img' command to create
   disk image for VM. For example, to create a 60GB disk image use: 
#+begin_example
qemu-img create -f qcow2 test_vm.qcow2 60G
#+end_example
+ Run below command to view the virtual machines in GUI mode.
#+begin_example
[root@base1 vms]# virt-manager
#+end_example
+ Click on =create new virtual machine= icon
+ Name your VM name and click on forward button.
+ Choose an ISO image from local disk for base1 use path as 
   =/mnt/das1/operating_systems= and select OS name and its version number.
+ Choose at least 4GB of RAM and 2 CPUs.
+ Choose radio button (Select managed or other existing storage) and browse for
  hard disk image for VM from location where it was created using qemu-img
  command. In our case it will be in =/mnt/das1/vms/test_vm/testvm.qcow2=
+ Check Customize configuration before install Use correct bridge for
  networking. You can use 'ifconfig' command on base machine to see which
  bridge in base machine is in 10.4.12.0/22 range and use it while creating new
  VM. Use =breth1= bridge in base1.
+ Then click on =Disk 1= choose advance options and select storage format as
  =qcow2=. And apply
+ Click on begin installation to start the os installation process.
+ Once OS installation is done please log into the machine using user name and
  password of the machine that you provided.
+ Configure eth0 interface to do so open file at =vim
  /etc/network/interfaces= and add the below details before that find the
  free available ip address in the range of 10.4.12.0/22 using =ping <ip>= command
#+begin_example
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address <ip-address>
netmask 255.255.252.0
gateway 10.4.12.236
#+end_example
+ Add gateway to resolve domain names edit =vim /etc/resolve.conf=
#+begin_example
nameserver 10.4.12.160
#+end_example
+ Restart the network manager to apply new changes
