#+TITLE:  Demo on Basic scaling of Open edX 
#+AUTHOR: Siva Shanker

* Before Scaling of Open edX
  - VM with
    + Ubuntu 14.04
    + 8GB RAM
    + t2.large
  - Setup complete Open edX platform in one machine
  - All edx Services are running in machine
    + LMS and CMS
    + MongoDB for CMS
    + MySql for LMS and analytics
    + and all other services such as forum, memcached and RabbitMQ.
** Performance
   + Consumed lot system resources (RAM, Cpus, etc) as it was running with
     all edx service in it.
   + Reduced system performance because of system resources
     consumption.

* Basic scaling of Open edX platform
  Because of the above performance issues, Basic scaling came into
  picture.
  - Basic scaling of Open edX platform with two VMs
    + Core machine : EdX platform with all the services
      - LMS and CMS
      - Databases: MySql and MongoDB
      - Other services: RabbitMQ, Memcached, forum
    + LMS machine
      - Activated LMS 
      - Stopped CMS 
      - Deactivated/Stopped other services
        + MySql
	+ MongoDB
        + Memcached 
        + RabbitMQ
 
* Load/Performance Test on Basic Open edX platform
  - siege :: Load/Stress tester on web server
  - System can allow *500 - 750* users to login
    - Average Transaction rate:       ~50 trans/sec
  - After login, *125-175* users can use the system simultaneously

** GitHub Issue 
   - [[https://github.com/openedx-vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/issues/39][Load test on Open edX platform]]

* Load/performance test on each production lab 
  - Easily, System can allow 300-500 users concurrently
