* Introduction
  Open edX platfom and analytics both are using databases. So we need
  to take backup of the databases and restore them.
* Requirements 
  1. Take backup of LMS/CMS (Open edX platform) and  LMS/CMS is restored from this backup. 
  2. Take backup of Open edX Analytics Pipeline and Pipeline is restored from this backup. 

* Take database backup of LMS and restore it
  This Section describes "how to take database backup? and how to restore
  it from this backup?"

  The Open edX platform is having two databases, they are:
  1. Mysql (LMS) 
  2. Mogodb (CMS)
** Taking backup of LMS machine
   - SSH to LMS machine 
   - Take backup of existing databases with following commands
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     sudo mongodump -o ./mongo-backup
     sudo mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > ./backup.sql
     
     # By default password for the root user would be empty
     #+END_SRC
** Restoring the database 
   - Use the following commnad to restore the databases.
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     sudo mongorestore -drop ./mongo-backup     
     sudo mysql -u root -p < ./backup.sql
