* Status as of July 11, 2016
  + [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/issues/27][Overall Plan for upcoming releases]]
  + [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/milestone/2][Release 2 : Porting of labs, customized analytics and customized theming]]
  + [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/milestone/3][Release 3 : Pilot workshop for Integration team]]
  + [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/milestone/4][Release 4 : Virtual labs integration workshop]]


** What are we confident with it ?
   + Setting up LMS and apply basic theming on edX
   + Porting labs to Open edX platform 
   + Setup basic analytiscs server with OAut established and get some analytics working and visible.

** What are we facing problem in ?
   + Setting up Analytics (Even though we were able to reproduce after
     taking help from Dr. Ramesh same steps never worked and we added new)
   + Our lack of knowledge of all the [[http://www.appsembler.com/blog/why-open-edx-hosting-is-so-complicated/][components]] used in Open edX.
   + A problem and issue is hard to corelate with the component because of [[http://www.appsembler.com/blog/why-open-edx-hosting-is-so-complicated/][complex structure]]. 
   + Lack of proper documentation and support for complex tasks. Many of our emails and queries are unanswered.
   
 

** Recent problems faced -
   + Setting up Analytics Data API server ::
     We used following links to see Analytics Data APIs. But these steps shows how to run APIs and how to see dummy data of analytics. We don't know how it works.
     - https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-pipeline/wiki/Running-the-analytics-backend-locally
     - https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-data-api

     - We mailed regarding this to google-groups for help, but we have not received any reply 
   + Execution of remote tasks ::
     - We are able to run some pipeline remote tasks but the thing is we are not aware of the parameters and their values in remote tasks
     - [[https://github.com/edx/edx-analytics-pipeline/wiki/Tasks-to-Run-to-Update-Insights][pipeline Remote tasks]]
    
   + Setting up Analytics ::

     - [[https://github.com/vlead/port-labs-to-openedx/issues/24][Analytics for Demography]]
