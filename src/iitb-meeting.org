#+Title: Skype meeting with IIT-Bombay Openedx Team 
#+Date: <2016-04-21 Thu>

* Introduction
  This document describes the discussion we had with IIT-Bombay team
  over skype to discuss edx related issues.

* Agenda
  1. How to make Insights work with LMS.
  2. How to customize and style lms

* Efforts
  - We have setup lms dogwood.0 (52.67.4.199) and customized it. We have setup
    analytics dogwood.0 (52.67.21.94).
  - We followed [[./openedx-installation.org]]

  

* Mrs.Sukla's suggestions 
  - Install edx with all necessary modules like course_discovery,
     oauth_client_setup,

  - Create dns names for lms, insights & preferrably cms services

  - Create the ssl certificates for both lms & insights on the
    respective machines under /etc/nginx/ssl directory

  - Change the configuration files for lms, insights under the
    /edx/app/nginx/sites­available on both machines for https protocol
    which will use the above certificates

  - Change the configuration files for lms & insights on respective
    machine. Configuration file for lms is
    /edx/app/edxapp/lms.env.json & for insights is
    /edx/etc/insights.yml to reflect the proper urls.

  - Edit the properties of trusted insights client created during
    installation using the lms admin,change the urls with the correct
    url (url & redirect url)

  - Synchronize the computer times of both insights & edx machine using
    'ntp'

  - Append the lms nginx certificate to the file
    /edx/app/insights/venvs/insights/lib/pyhton2.7/requests/cacert.pem

  - Restart all services under supervisorctl & nginx service on both
    machines
* Summary

     insights. We need to follow those steps.
